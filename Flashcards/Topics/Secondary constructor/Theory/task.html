  <p>You already know how to work with primary constructors. However, they have their limitations. For example, you may need to create several different constructors for the same class but you can't do that with a primary constructor alone. That's where secondary, or custom, constructors come in handy.</p> 
  <h2>Custom constructor</h2> 
  <p>You can declare <strong>custom constructors</strong> for a class along with a primary constructor or without one.</p> 
  <p>To declare a secondary constructor, write the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> inside the class body and parentheses with the constructor's parameters after the keyword. Then, put curly braces with the constructor logic inside:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Now you can create objects in one line, just as if you were using a primary constructor:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(3, 4)
val size2 = Size(5, 1)</code></pre> 
  <p>Be careful: you have to either use an implicit constructor or declare your own, but you cannot use both at the same time:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }
}

val size = Size() // Error! No values passed for parameters _width and _height</code></pre> 
  <p>What you can do is create a replica of the default constructor explicitly (empty curly braces can be removed):</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor() {
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <h2>Multiple constructors</h2> 
  <p>Creating several constructors for a class is almost as simple as creating just one, but there is a particular constraint you need to keep in mind. Every secondary constructor has to have a unique signature. You cannot use the same signature for the primary or any other constructor.</p> 
  <p>The constructor signature consists of the number, the types, and the order of the parameters. To create a valid constructor, you need to make sure it has a unique list of parameters. As an example, look at the following constructors for the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_height: Int) {
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Double) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }

    constructor(_height: Double, _width: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>The code below will create four <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> objects with the same property values using different constructors:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(7) // uses 1st constructor
val size2 = Size(0,7) // uses 2nd constructor
val size3 = Size(0, 7.0) // uses 3rd constructor
val size4 = Size(7.0, 0) // uses 4th constructor</code></pre> 
  <p>Remember that signatures are defined by the types of the parameters, not by their names. For example, the compiler can not tell these two constructors apart, even if they look different for a person:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {}
constructor(x: Int, y: Int) {}</code></pre> 
  <p>So, implemented in the same class, these constructors will cause an error.</p> 
  <h2><code class="language-kotlin">this</code> keyword</h2> 
  <p>Inside the class code, you can also access the object members using the "dot and member name" syntax. Since you usually don't know the object name, there is a special keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> that represents the current object.</p> 
  <p>For example, you can use it to name the constructor parameters the same as the class properties. Let's change the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <h2>Omitting default values</h2> 
  <p>Kotlin classes have a useful feature: you don't have to declare a default property value if the value is assigned in the constructor of the class:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int
    var height: Int

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>In this case, we can change <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">val</code>, and the <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> object will be immutable. For the sake of demonstration, let's add another property:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    val width: Int
    val height: Int
    val area: Int

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
        this.area = width * height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <h2>Constructor execution</h2> 
  <p>If a class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to call the primary constructor, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). This is called <strong>delegation</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done with the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> placed after the constructor arguments and before the constructor body:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    var area: Int = width * height

    init {
        println("Object with area equal to $area is created")
    }

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
        outerSize.area -= this.area
        println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Delegation to the primary constructor becomes the first statement of a secondary constructor, so the initializer blocks and property initialization are executed before the secondary constructor code.</p> 
  <p>Let's create two objects using the <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> class code above:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val outerObject = Size(5, 8)
val innerObject = Size(2, 3, outerObject)</code></pre> 
  <p>Because of the order of execution, the output will be the following:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Object with area equal to 40 is created
Object with area equal to 6 is created
Updated outer object's area is equal to 34</code></pre> 
  <p>If a class has no primary constructor, the delegation still happens implicitly, and initializer blocks are still executed:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    init {
        println("Init block; width = $width, height = $height")
    }

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
        println("Secondary constructor block; width = $width, height = $height")
    }
}

val size = Size(5, 6)</code></pre> 
  <p>The output for the code above will be the following:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Init block; width = 0, height = 0
Secondary constructor block; width = 5, height = 6</code></pre> 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>Let's review the key points from the topic before you can move on to practice.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A class can also declare secondary constructors. They have to be prefixed with the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code>.</li> 
   <li>Each constructor within the same class must have a unique signature.</li> 
   <li>Object members inside the class code can be accessed with <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> keyword.</li> 
   <li>Default values can be omitted if property values are assigned in the constructor.</li> 
   <li>The code in the initializer blocks effectively becomes part of the primary constructor.</li> 
   <li>Secondary constructor code is executed after the primary constructor, initializer blocks, and property initialization.</li> 
  </ul>
